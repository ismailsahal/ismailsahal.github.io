    <h1>My Hobbies and Some Interests</h1>
    <hr />
    <h2>Photography</h2>

    <p>I'm an amateur photographer, interested in both urban and landscape photography. Started in my college
        years, it's been a passion of mine for about 6 years now. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ismsahal">Here</a>
        is my public instagram page where I share almost
        exclusively my photography products.</p>

    <h2>Basketball</h2>
    <p>Huuge basketball fan. Been enjoying watching, following and playing it since my childhood. I love where the NBA
        is heading in many ways!</p>

    <h2>Billiards</h2>
    <p>Not really a follower of all the tournaments and the professional scene but I bet I will be a competitive player
        in a friendly tournament!</p>

    <h2>Video Games</h2>
    <p>I've been a gamer since childhood, mostly on PC. Despite my interest in many genres, I'm a relatively competitive
        Counter-Strike player. I love following the professional scene, watching the tournaments and the feel of
        satisfaction in winning in this game! </p>
