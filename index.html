    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm an aspiring web developer living in the Denver Metro Area. I'm currently getting better
        at web development and this website is made using only HTML to showcase what I've learned to create with it.
        Hopefully I will be making much more improved versions of this website using CSS and JS in the upcoming weeks.
